// Checks what publishing the kit to npm with provenance, through npm's trusted
// publishing, needs, as far as it can without a token. The release workflow's
// npm jobs run it before npm stage publish (or, in the dry run, npm publish
// --dry-run):
//
//   node .github/scripts/check-npm-provenance.mjs
//
// npm's own dry run skips provenance, so this checks what it will need:
// - npm 11.15.0 or later, which stages a publish with a GitHub Actions ID token,
//   and the Node it needs, 22.14 or later;
// - the package's repository.url names this repository, which npm checks
//   against the provenance;
// - the package isn't marked private;
// - the repository is public, since npm only takes provenance from a public one;
// - the package is public on npm, read with no credentials. A trusted publisher
//   can only be set up for a package that's already there, so the first version
//   was published by hand;
// - it runs in release.yml, the workflow npm's trusted publisher names.
//
// It asks for no token, and publishes nothing. It only runs in GitHub Actions.
// A real release's npm job has an ID token, which this leaves alone.
